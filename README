These are some Python wrappers to Fortran subroutines useful in
Orbital Mechanics, such as orbit propagation, solution of the Lambert's
problem, conversion between position and velocity vectors and classical
orbital elements and orbit plotting.

    from poliastro.examples import molniya

Fortran subroutines
-------------------

The core of poliastro is possible thanks to several Fortran subroutines,
written by David A. Vallado for his book "Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and
Applications" and available on the Internet as the `companion software of
the book`__.

.. __: http://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.asp

The author explicitly gave permission to redistribute these subroutines
in this project under the current license.

Some of them were slightly modified due to errors in the build process,
the handling of relative errors in comparisons and to make them more
suitable to use with different gravitational parameters.

Requirements
============

poliastro requires NumPy and Astropy and is usually tested on Linux
on Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 (single codebase).

Besides, a Fortran compiler is needed to build the extensions. poliastro
is usually built with gfortran.

There is no reason it shouldn't work under Windows or Mac OS X with
properly configured tools (not tested).

Installation
============

To install poliastro just use pip::

  $ pip install poliastro

To install poliastro from source, just type::

  $ python setup.py install

It is recommended that you **never ever use sudo** with distutils, pip,
setuptools and friends in Linux because you might seriously break your
system [1_][2_][3_][4_]. Options are `per user directories`_, `virtualenv`_
or `local installations`_.

Testing
=======

If installed correctly, this should work::

  $ python -c "import poliastro; poliastro.test()"
  Running unit tests for poliastro
  [...]
  OK

Code contributions are welcome! Just send a pull request and we'll discuss it.
In the `wiki`_ you can find some documents explaining the overall design of
poliastro, and in the `issue tracker`_ you may find pending tasks waiting for
someone to complete them.

FAQ
===

Does it work on Windows?
------------------------

I had some problems to find a free Fortran compiler for Windows 64-bit
(but I am `not alone`__).

Have you considered `choosing another operative system`__?

What's up with the name?
------------------------

poliastro comes from Polimi, which is the shortened name of the Politecnico di
Milano, the Italian university where I've been studying while writing this
software. It's my tiny tribute to a place I've come to love. *Grazie mille!*
